// 0.3.175 (S3) effects buckets, RenderProfile sample frames only: the effects wall time (renderEffects,
// the cpuEffects scope) split into contiguous buckets. Each mark(b) reads the clock once and bills the
// span since the previous mark to b, so the buckets sum to the whole (begin to end) and a mark that is
// not reached (an early return) rolls its span into the next one. The mod's draw calls (the counted
// raw DrawIndexedPrimitive/DrawPrimitive/UP calls) are billed the same way. Off (every other frame):
// begin(false) and every mark() return at once, no clock read. Portable: the caller supplies the clock.
